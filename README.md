# 🔱 Motorized Mace – Arduino Powered Self-Defense System

This is the official code and documentation for the **Motorized Mace** project — a modern robotic reinterpretation of *Kaumodaki*, the mythological mace of Lord Vishnu.

Built as part of a robotics fest challenge, this project blends **automation**, **electronics**, and **mythological inspiration** to create a self-defense mechanism that activates the moment a threat is detected.

## ⚙️ Features

- **Arduino-controlled automated activation**
- **Ultrasonic sensor** detects nearby motion
- **DC gear motor** spins spiked flails rapidly
- **Hands-free defense** — no manual button required
- Inspired by Indian mythology’s most iconic blunt-force weapon

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** continuously measures distance.
2. If an object is detected within a predefined range (e.g., 50 cm), the Arduino:
   - Triggers the **motor driver**
   - Activates the **DC gear motor**
3. The motor spins a spiked foam ball attached via a chain, simulating a defensive strike.
4. The system is **fully automated** — no switches or manual input required.
